My short term memory is severely lacking and is the driving force behind me writing and recording everything I see. To help myself stay on track with all my desires and dreams I have written out and categorized them such that they are easily understood. With each reflection upon my life I wish to measure my progress toward these goals as well as assess the worth of the goal itself in the grand scheme. I think the best method for following through with goals is the through the method of divide-and-conquer. I will only preface large goals on the site and day to day activities are omitted.
