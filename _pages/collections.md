I want to keep track of all the datasets, libraries, and applications that I find useful. This way they are all condensed to a single location. Furthermore

## Applications
[Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable) : Amazing note taking application  
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) : Deep Learning Toolbox  
[GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai/) : Gaussian Processes implementation using PyTorch as base.  
[GPFlow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow) : Gaussian Processes implementation using Tensorflow as base.  
[SeDuMi](http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/) : Optimization solver that solves for objectives over symmetric cones  
[GloptiPoly 3](http://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/software/gloptipoly/) : Generalized moment optimzation solver that handles polynomial data
