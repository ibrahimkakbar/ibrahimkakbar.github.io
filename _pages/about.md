Introduction
======
I am a current first year Master's student at UC San Diego. My broad interests lying in mis-spelling words consecutively and repetitively. I am an avid sock enthusiast when I take breaks from my brain gymnastics. I also thoroughly enjoy getting sidetracked from learning one subject by learning another subject. Hence Wikipedia is the bane of my existence. I enjoy broad or abstract concepts in the hopes of enabling robots to be able to also learn simple concepts or axioms that they could adapt around, rather than learning through empirical determination. I also strive to help propel the field of planning and control; although how is something that I am currently trying to question myself!

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
