I am a second year Masters student in the ECE Department at UC San Diego studying robotics and artificial intelligence. I'm in the process of finishing up my thesis so wish me luck!

I love learning math and enjoy applying it to robotics. I want to develop robots that are able to coexisting with humans and provide novel solutions to major issues such as environmental cleaning/management and disaster or medical aid.
