\section{Experiments}

The proposed method, DVI, is evaluated with small networks on UCI datasets in comparison with a large variety of other methods in the Appendix showing that it is capable of performing at the state of art in terms of log-likelihood. Furthermore, the algorithm is also tested extensively on it's own with a variety of configurations in the BNNs to see how the main assumptions hold of CLT, indepdendence, and trunctated polynomial hold. A further study that would be interesting would compare the variance estimates to observe the a rate of decay.
