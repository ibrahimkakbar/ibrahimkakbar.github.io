The first time I built a Quadcopter it was with the goal in mind of being able to fly from anywhere. It was quite 
the ambitious statement, but my good friend, [Matt Dombroski](https://mattdombro.wordpress.com), is always up for a 
rediculous challenge. Thus we got a group of friends together and what came into existence is our quadcopter, Jerry.  
We developed the flight controller from scratch using a TI Tiva C Series Launchpad ARM, broke through many frames 
and props, led a war on sleep, got a Raspberry PI to communicate with an Xbox Controller through LTE, and set up a 
server in hopes that we had enough bandwidth to stream video at a reasonable rate.
